At its first session in 1999, the Committee recognized that the EDI used in earlier reviews had reflected some elements of vulnerability, but it felt that this reflection was inadequate to cover the Committee's notion of vulnerability as "structural vulnerability", defined as the risk of being negatively affected by unforeseen events beyond the control of a country.  The Committee, therefore, proposed that the former EDI be replaced by an economic vulnerability index (EVI).27 107.

In addition, the Ministry of Defence noted the following advances in the area of gender equity: (1) the post of Senior Presidential Advisor on Gender Equity was created; and (2) a comprehensive policy framework was established that provides for the recognition of sexual and reproductive rights, the prevention of violence and aggression and the equal exercise of political (the Quota Act), social and cultural rights, among other important provisions.  With respect to ways of promoting the role of women in disarmament, nonproliferation and arms control, we suggest that (1) representatives of women's groups and associations be included in discussion panels and programmes on the topic; (2) advisory boards be established within national and international disarmament programmes, in coordination with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women); and (3) military observatories for gender equality be promoted as entities providing technical and administrative support for the inclusion of women in such programmes.

While welcoming the deployment of ad hoc multinational forces to provide stability and a smooth entry for eventual peacekeeping missions in Liberia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we nevertheless concur with the Secretary-General that they raise important questions about the kind resources required to ensure the success of peacekeeping.  In the case of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we believe that an honest assessment of the situation would have revealed to the Security Council the need to mandate, from the beginning, the deployment of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) under Chapter VII of the Charter, backed up with the necessary robust capabilities to ensure its credibility.
